As an MIT Ph.D. graduate with a strong focus on manufacturing system engineering, a subdivision of operations research, my academic career is marked by significant contributions to the field through numerous top-tier journal publications. My research expertise lies in the optimization of manufacturing systems, advancing both theoretical and practical aspects of operations research. 

In the industry, I have leveraged my analytical skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, gaining rich experience in applying these competencies to real-world large-scale financial data. My leadership in authoring 《因子投资：方法与实践》(Factor Investing: Methodology and Practice (in Chinese)) has established the book as one of the most significant works in China's asset management industry. This blend of high-level academic inquiry and practical industry application uniquely positions me to deliver valuable insights and innovations in the field of data science.
