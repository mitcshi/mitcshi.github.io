</header>

In the high-speed NC machining process, in order to avoid impact, overshoot and oscillation in the start and stop processes of machine tools, and enhance the machining efficiency and accuracy, an S-shape curve feedrate control method was put forward. According to the characteristics of the trajectory, eight possible diverse methods of feedrate control were generalized. Aiming at each method, the paper presents a specific mathematical description through analytic equation or iteration, simulates and seeks the solution for the feedrate control.
