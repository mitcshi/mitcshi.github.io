When machining complex contours, the frequent starting and stopping of the machining tool feed system reduces the machining efficiency and the machining quality. A new control algorithm was developed to realize smooth transfers along a continuous segment trajectory. The control algorithm solution process was described with an error analysis. A mathematical model of a servo system with a lead screw drive was used to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the servo system in the transfer process. The results illustrate the control algorithm efficiency. A machining simulation shows that the machining efficiency is enhanced by 14.1% and the trajectory error is smaller than 3 Î¼m which proves the feasibility of the algorithm in an actual machining process. This algorithm effectively improves machining efficiency and contour quality.
